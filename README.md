The telegraph marked the beginning of near instant communication. The introduction of this technology allowed for the first time for communication and transportation to be seperate, meaning that instead of someone having to hand deliver letters the information could be simply transmitted to stations. This in turn had a great impact on the economy, because in company with the locomotive it allowed for long distance transactions.However, some communication was lost between the buyer and seller. In order to cut costs shorter messages had to be sent. The telegraph also marked the ability to transfer money over these long distances. The telegraph would soon be overtaken by new technologies, but many were based off the original invention. While James W. Carey seems to be saying in his Technology and Ideology: The Case of The Telegraph he says the telegraphed is overlooked however in my opinion with the impact that it had on all aspects of the american society it could not have been overlooked. While yes compared to the industrial revolution it is studied less I think it is still highly regarded as a turning point in american society and technology.
	As with everything the era of the telegraph was always destined to end. That is simply the nature of society. In Tim Wu’s The Master Switch his claims of cyclicality in the technological shifts I believe to be inherently true. While yes today the internet is the center of most people’s daily lives it will definitely shift toward something new in  the future. A key factor for a society is growth. Stagnancy in society leads to chaos and eventually extinction. Human society is incapable of seeing the possibilities that we constantly have for growth, so it is easy to believe that this is the pinnacle of technology and advancements.
	The Low Tech Magazine has some good insight on how the development of our technological future can come from anywhere. Since the internet has revolutionized how people communicate and interact with one another the necessity for it in impoverished areas is considerable.  For poor communities to advance out of their poverty it is necessary for them to be able to communicate and advance in their education. With the invention of low tech internet and wifi-based long distance networks poor communities should be able to advance quicker than in the past. This research on low tech internet has brought into light the inefficiency of our modern networks. Modern service ISP’s have been using traditional systems of advancement and more of a brute force out look through money and energy to get higher access speeds, rather than actual innovation. Low tech internet shows that their could possibly be alternative techniques to the traditional that allow access speed to increase while not increasing the cost and energy. 
	Our society is still early in our technological expansion and their is much for growth. The cycles that govern us will push us toward new innovation that allow for greater knowledge to continue the cycle of humanity.
